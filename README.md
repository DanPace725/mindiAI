# Credits

Mindi is built on the foundations of several open-source projects. We are thankful to the developers and contributors of these projects:

## Chatbot UI

The conversational interface of Mindi is powered by [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui), an open-source project developed by McKay Wrigley. It provides a responsive and intuitive chat interface, which we have integrated and customized for Mindi's unique functionalities.

## BlockNote

Mindi's note-taking functionality leverages [BlockNote](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote), an open-source rich text editor designed for structured note-taking and documentation. Its modular design and feature-rich interface have been instrumental in creating an integrated note management system in Mindi.
